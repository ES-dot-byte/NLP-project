# NLP-project
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user inputs. The chatbot matches user queries with predefined intents from a JSON file and provides relevant responses. It can be extended with machine learning models for more advanced intent classification.
