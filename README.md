# **Overview**:
The Chatbot Project is a simple yet powerful AI-driven chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to recognize user inputs, predict their intents, and respond appropriately based on predefined patterns and responses. The project leverages NLTK for text processing and includes a Flask web application for easy deployment.

# **Features**:
**Natural Language Understanding:** Processes user input using tokenization and lemmatization techniques.
**Pattern Matching:** Matches user input to predefined patterns and provides relevant responses.
**Web Interface:** Powered by Flask, allowing interaction with the chatbot via a web interface.
**Extensibility:** Capable of being expanded with machine learning models like TensorFlow for more advanced intent recognition.

# **Requirements**:
To run this project, install the following libraries:
!pip install nltk tensorflow flask numpy matplotlib

# **Libraries Used:**
**NLTK:** Natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
**TensorFlow:** Optional for machine learning-based intent classification.
**Flask:** Web framework to deploy the chatbot.
**NumPy:** For numerical computations and array manipulations.
**Matplotlib:** For visualizations (optional).

# **How to Run**:
**Step 1:** Install Dependencies
!pip install nltk tensorflow flask numpy matplotlib
**Step 2:** Run the Chatbot Locally

**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/raHHlu/chatbot_project.git
cd chatbot_project

**Run the Python script:**
python app.py

**If using Flask for web deployment, access the chatbot via:**
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
**Step 3:** Interact with the Chatbot
Open the command-line interface or the web interface and type your queries.
Type 'quit' to exit the chatbot.

# **How It Works**:
Intent Classification: The chatbot matches user input against predefined patterns in intents.json.
Response Generation: Once an intent is identified, the chatbot returns a corresponding response.
Flask Web Interface: Deploy the chatbot as a web app for easier interaction.

# **Future Enhancements**:
Machine Learning Models: Integrate advanced ML models for dynamic intent classification.
Voice Integration: Add voice-based input/output using speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs.
Expand Intents: Add more intents and patterns for richer user interactions.
